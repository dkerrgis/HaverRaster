# HaverDst
Module to apply haversine distance (degrees to meters) in all target cells of geotiff

## Notes
This package will currently calculate decimal degree distances in meters to closest feature (internal distances become negative) using multiple cpus on a local PC. Multinode processing is currently being developed.
